This sample code is a gentle introduction to the very basics of MongoDB and Mongomapper.

First, edit the model.rb file with the correct connection configuration (replace the "x" with actual values).

Then, store a quote by running write.rb:

     ruby write.rb "Peter" "Lecturer" "Do your homework."

Last, retrieve all values in the quotes collection by running read.rb:

     ruby read.rb
